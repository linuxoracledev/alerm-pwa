A simple **Progressive Web App (PWA)** alarm clock that runs in your browser or can be installed as a standalone app.   It plays a sound and shows notifications **every 20 minutes between 10:00 AM and 6:00 PM, Sunday–Thursday** — useful for work/break reminders, productivity cycles, or hydration alerts.
